Objective:

     Implement a bucket sort and a radix sort.


Description:


     1. Using the author's sort code, add a bucket sort method to sort a list of Integers. 

     2. Using the author's sort code, add a radix sort method to sort a list of Integers. 

     3. Modify the main method in the author's code to call your bucket sort for random lists of size 100000, 200000, and 1000000, where the values range from 0 to 1000, outputting the time required for each size.  

     4. Modify the main method in the author's code to call your radix sort for random lists of size 100000, 200000, and 1000000, where the values range from 0 to 1000, outputting the time required for each size.
